MECCS4510 - Traveling Salesman Problem

# tsp.txt - Official assignment file
Solve this traveling salesman problem file with 1000 datapoints using your
evolutionary algorithm.

# tsp_10.txt - Test file
A simple test file with only 10  datapoints for you to test if your
algorithm works.

# Top Tip:
Make your own test file to debug your algorithm. For example: make a file of
coordinates sampled from a circle or an ellipse, so the solution is obvious.
